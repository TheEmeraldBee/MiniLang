# Mini Lang

## A language written solo by TheEmeraldBee that is slightly based off of the concepts of [Brainfuck](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiizIrFlaf7AhVxM0QIHe6wCSkQFnoECA4QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBrainfuck&usg=AOvVaw2bY6NBxdi5kr77KdCA6uvC)
> This language is actively being developed, and may change drastically in the future.
> Although this language is mostly a joke, I am currently programming it with many features planned.

#### These Plans Include:
- [X] Functions
- [ ] Importing Files
- [x] Error Handling Through Try - Except Blocks
- [x] Better Error Logging
- Many, many optimizations and fixes to the language.

## Documentation
>This will be added soon, but due to the rapid development at current times, I am unable to predict the future of the project
> and will be waiting to add this for a couple of days. However, if you still want to try it, use the SimpleDefaultLibrary and
> look up a tutorial for Brainfuck, as the SimpleDefaultLibrary is very similar. The major difference is if you want to do
> something more than once, type command_ and replace command with a brainfuck command, and the underscore with a number! 
> 
> EX: +5

#### Note:
This is a passion project for me, and am not sure how long my plans will go till, but as long as people are interested,
and I'm interested, and I will be adding to the language.
