# Mini Lang

## A Language Written Solo By EmeraldBee that is slightly based off of the concepts of [Brainfuck](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiizIrFlaf7AhVxM0QIHe6wCSkQFnoECA4QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBrainfuck&usg=AOvVaw2bY6NBxdi5kr77KdCA6uvC)
> This Language is actively being developed, and may change drastically in the future.
> Although This language is mostly a troll, I am currently programming it with many features planned.

#### These Plans Include:
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Importing Files
- [ ] Error Handling Through Try - Except Blocks
- [ ] Better Error Logging
- Many, many optimizations and fixes to the language.

#### Note:
This is a passion project for me, and am not sure how long my plans will go till, but as long as people are interested,
and I'm interested, I will be adding to the language.
